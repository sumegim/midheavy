  "description": "<p><strong>The Confrontation</strong> is a board game in which players take control of the forces of Sauron, seeking to find their master&rsquo;s ring, or the forces of the free peoples of Middle Earth seeking to destroy Sauron's ring in the fires of Mount Doom. <em>The Confrontation</em> allows players to control many of the famous characters of Tolkien's famous trilogy, while playing an intense 30-minute game that is a combination of bluffing and strategy. <em>The Confrontation</em> is designed by renowned game designer <a  href=\"/boardgamedesigner/2/reiner-knizia\"   >Reiner Knizia</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deluxe Confrontation</strong> gives the game a new and larger gameboard, larger sculpted plastic stands, and completely new artwork and graphic design.  The game includes 18 entirely new characters in addition to the classic characters found in the original. The new characters allow players to play an entirely new game, or mix the new and the old characters for an entirely different game experience.  4 new Special Cards are also included, for additional special actions.</p>\n\n",

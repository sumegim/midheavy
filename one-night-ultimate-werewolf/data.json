  "description": "<p>No moderator, no elimination, ten-minute games.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</strong></em> is a fast game for 3-10 players in which everyone gets a role: One of the dastardly Werewolves, the tricky Troublemaker, the helpful Seer, or one of a dozen different characters, each with a special ability. In the course of a single morning, your village will decide who is a werewolf...because all it takes is lynching one werewolf to win!</p>\n\n<p>Because <em>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</em> is so fast, fun, and engaging, you'll want to play it again and again, and no two games are ever the same.</p>\n\n<p>This game can be combined with <a  href=\"/boardgame/163166/one-night-ultimate-werewolf-daybreak\"   >One Night Ultimate Werewolf: Daybreak</a>.</p>\n\n",

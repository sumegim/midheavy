Three factions &mdash; the Scottish, the Welsh, and the English &mdash; vie for control and, across the sea, foreign invaders prepare to take advantage of the chaos. Players must marshal their limited resources to influence this power struggle, while ensuring that the faction that rises to dominate the realm favors them above all other claimants to the throne.</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>The King is Dead: Second Edition</strong></em> refreshes the accessible yet strikingly deep game with updated graphic design, gorgeous new artwork, and a brand-new asymmetric game mode for advanced play.</p>\n\n",

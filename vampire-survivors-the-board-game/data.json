  "description": "<p><em><strong>Vampire Survivors: The Board Game</strong></em> is a tabletop version of the video game. Brave heroes battle seemingly unending waves of enemies as they hope to survive as long as possible!</p>\n\n<p>This cooperative deck building game has several unique characters, which players will deploy on the gameboard. They must do battle with with fiendish creatures who seek only to exterminate their existence. Players gather weapons and items to increase their powers and gather new abilities so they may outlast the vampire onslaught.</p>\n\n<p>If the players can live long enough, they will make it to the end and win the game, even though Death itself will arrive to destroy them utterly.</p>\n\n<p>But maybe, even Death can die.</p>\n\n<p><em>&mdash;description from the publisher</em></p>\n\n",

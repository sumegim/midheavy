description: 'Magic Maze: Hidden Roles presents a new challenge when your group of
  adventurers is trying to grab the right items and exit the maze. Turns out that
  one or more of you might not actually be interested in leaving. Yes, you have a
  traitor in your midst, someone who is trying to thwart the team from exiting &mdash;
  but if they get called out during the game, then someone else gets to claim their
  action and take charge of it, so they''ll need to be sneaky in order to keep the
  clock running and let the team fail.


  Hidden Roles also includes challenge cards that players might acquire before or
  during play: visit this location, claim that object. Can you make others help you
  achieve your hidden goal?


  Note from publisher: These expansions don''t work with fewer than 3 players.'

  "description": "In this trick-taking game based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson of the same name, the goal is to gain the most points over a series of hands (usually the goal is set to 200 pts). Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered trump and will win the trick.",

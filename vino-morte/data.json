Perhaps in the B&eacute;arnaise sauce?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Regardless, two things are abundantly clear: someone is poisoning the guests at this party, and the wine that is being poured may be the last you ever taste.</em></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>In Vino Morte </strong></em> is a tiny little bluffing/deduction game.</p>\n\n<p>In the game, the dealer will choose and distribute wine/poison cards and each player has an opportunity to keep theirs and drink it, or swap with another player. It's quick, fun and sneaky and works with a large group.</p>\n\n",

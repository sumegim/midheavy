The harmony determines how many suits must be played in the trick&mdash;not being able to is considered playing &ldquo;off-harmony,&rdquo; making that player ineligible for points.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the trick, the player who played the highest on-harmony card scores two points, and the lowest on-harmony card scores for the value of that card (those bass notes are so important!).</p>\n\n",

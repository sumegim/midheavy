  "description": "<p><em><strong>3 Witches</strong></em> is a must-follow,  trick-taking game with no trump suit. At the start of each round, players bid on how many tricks they can win (out of five). The highest bidder becomes the Lead Witch, and their opponents play together on a team as Lesser Witches.</p>\n\n<p>The Lead Witch plays two cards (one face down), while the two Lesser Witches combine one card each. Two ingredients of the same rank or suit get added together, leading to tricky situations!</p>\n\n<p>If the Lead Witch wins exactly the number of tricks that they bid, they receive two fate tokens at the end of the round; if not, each Lesser Witch receives one fate token. The first player to collect five fate tokens wins.</p>\n\n<p><em>&mdash;description from the publisher</em></p>\n\n",

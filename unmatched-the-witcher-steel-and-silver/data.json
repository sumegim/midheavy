  "description": "<p>In battle, there are no equals.</p>\n\n<p><em>Unmatched</em> is a highly asymmetrical miniature fighting game for two or four players. Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Unmatched: Steel and Silver</strong></em> has three playable characters: Geralt of Rivia, Ciri, and the Ancient Leshen. Each character comes with one or two companion tokens. Also has two battlefields from the Witcher series including the Witcher stronghold, Kaer Morhen.</p>\n\n",

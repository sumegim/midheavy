  "description": "<p>Some animals have begun their migration, going around and around in search of a new place to live. Hippos that love both water and land. Huge elephants. And bears that just want to be left alone. &quot;Uhhhh,&quot; you can't help but growl as the cards go around. You want to secure the perfect spot, but should you choose a location or an animal first? Take one card at a time and pass the rest around in this &quot;drafting&quot; style game.</p>\n\n<p>You have spectacular savannas, lakes brimming with possibilities, and jungles full of the unknown at your disposal! So, which animals will you welcome in and where will you put them?</p>\n\n<p>Match just the right animals with just the right locations and create the most harmonious national park ever!</p>\n\n<p><em>&mdash;description from the publisher</em></p>\n\n",

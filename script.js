Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices.

The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe.

The game begins in the early eighteenth-century, when the Company has a weak foothold on the subcontinent. Over the course of the game, the Company might grow into the most powerful and insidious corporation in the world or collapse under the weight of its own ambition.</p>\n\n<p><em>John Company</em> is a game about state-sponsored trade monopoly. Unlike most economic games players often do not control their own firms. Instead, they will collectively guide the Company by securing positions of power, attempting to steer the Company&rsquo;s fate in ways that benefit their own interests. However, the Company is an unwieldy thing. It is difficult to do anything alone, and players will often need to negotiate with one another. In John Company, most everything is up for negotiation.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this game isn&rsquo;t about wealth; it&rsquo;s about reputation. Each turn some of your family members may retire from their Company positions, giving them the opportunity to establish estates. Critically, players do not have full control over when these retirements happen. You will often need to borrow money from other players to make the best use for a chance of retirement. Players also gain victory points by competing in the London Season for prestige and securing fashionable properties.</p>\n\n<p><em>John Company</em> engages very seriously with its theme. It is meant as a frank portrait of an institution that was as dysfunctional as it was influential. Accordingly, the game wrestles many of the key themes of imperialism and globalization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and how those developments were felt domestically. As such, this game might not be suitable for all players.

Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.</p>\n\n<p>To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.</p>\n\n<p>After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.</p>\n\n", 'maxplayers': '5', 'maxplaytime': '120', 'minplayers': '1', 'minplaytime': '45', 'numcomments': '2324', 'numfans': 1467, 'numgeeklists': '1681', 'numhasparts': '10', 'numowned': '19850', 'numplays': '49164', 'numplays_month': '911', 'numprevowned': '1234', 'numtrading': '177', 'numwanting': '895', 'numwantparts': '1', 'numweights': '648', 'numwish': '5732', 'numwishlistcomments': '533', 'playmonth': '2024-02', 'short_description': 'Swing the tides of "The Great Game" as countries vie for control of Afghanistan.', 'stddev': '1.50426', 'usersrated': '13268', 'views': '1749040', 'yearpublished': '2019'}}, {'id': 'poker', 'name': 'Poker', 'description': "You've got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.", 'q_rules': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18iHT3TUfxDYVeoSnzX661quh1CNTBuxp?usp=drive_link', 'links': [], 'labels': ['Classic', 'Card Game', 'Family Game', 'Strategy', 'Bluffing'], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1115/poker', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QhsvR9GY0LbTpj27fairWA__opengraph/img/FFuk1EuC8UkRBQhlznzheUMpbbs=/0x61:509x347/fit-in/1200x630/filters:fill(blur):strip_icc()/pic186610.jpg', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '6.71605', 'avgweight': '2.4258', 'baverage': '6.47637', 'description': '<p><strong>Poker</strong> is played with a <a class="" href="/wiki/page/standard_deck_playing_card_games#">standard deck</a> of 52-cards, and sometimes Jokers are added as wild cards.

A player who reaches 7 points wins the whole game. If the other player failed to gain any points in the meantime, the game is a <em>Bummerl</em> of double value. This only matters if playing a match of multiple games, which ends once a player reaches a previously agreed upon number of points.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose &quot;no trump&quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.</p>\n\n<p>The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may <em>always</em> play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.</p>\n\n<p>After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.</p>\n\n<p>After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.</p>\n\n<p>A common variant in <em>Wizard</em> is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.</p>\n\n', 'maxplayers': '6', 'maxplaytime': '45', 'minplayers': '3', 'minplaytime': '45', 'numcomments': '2265', 'numfans': 274, 'numgeeklists': '1896', 'numhasparts': '6', 'numowned': '19965', 'numplays': '52237', 'numplays_month': '287', 'numprevowned': '1233', 'numtrading': '339', 'numwanting': '54', 'numwantparts': '6', 'numweights': '578', 'numwish': '553', 'numwishlistcomments': '121', 'playmonth': '2024-02', 'short_description': "Predict how many tricks you'll win, with the help of Wizards and Jesters.", 'stddev': '1.40867', 'usersrated': '11288', 'views': '549727', 'yearpublished': '1984'}}];

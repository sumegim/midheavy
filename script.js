To play, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value.

A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play, as it can with bonus moves that allow the player to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder. Each player also starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.</p>\n\n<p>Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner's dominance in this area.</p>\n\n<p>You can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>\n\n", 'maxplayers': '2', 'maxplaytime': '30', 'minplayers': '2', 'minplaytime': '30', 'numcomments': '12173', 'numfans': 5084, 'numgeeklists': '6803', 'numhasparts': '31', 'numowned': '152884', 'numplays': '488537', 'numplays_month': '191', 'numprevowned': '6716', 'numtrading': '950', 'numwanting': '924', 'numwantparts': '24', 'numweights': '2894', 'numwish': '10867', 'numwishlistcomments': '1430', 'playmonth': '2024-03', 'short_description': 'Science?

At first, on a turn, your family gets to take only two actions, one for you and one for your spouse, as might be found among all the possibilities on a farm: plowing fields; collecting materials; building fences, and so on. There are numerous choices available, and while the game progresses you'll have more and more, as each round a new action card is flipped over, offering one more possible action. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished but first you'll need to expand your house to make room--and what are you going to feed all the little rug rats?</p>\n\n<p>The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the distribution of cards which represent <em>Minor Improvements</em> and <em>Occupations</em>. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release) these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist. Each player starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit into his/her strategy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agricola</strong> is a turn-based game, and the problem to be overcome is that each available action can be taken by only one player each round so it's important to be careful about your choices.  There are countless strategies, some of which depend on your hand of cards.  Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...</p>\n\n", 'maxplayers': '5', 'maxplaytime': '150', 'minplayers': '1', 'minplaytime': '30', 'numcomments': '14039', 'numfans': 6797, 'numgeeklists': '15924', 'numhasparts': '57', 'numowned': '88141', 'numplays': '285914', 'numplays_month': '396', 'numpreordered': '151', 'numprevowned': '9916', 'numtrading': '1426', 'numwanting': '1142', 'numwantparts': '54', 'numwanttobuy': '3044', 'numwanttoplay': '7339', 'numweights': '6406', 'numwish': '12692', 'numwishlistcomments': '1181', 'playmonth': '2025-06', 'short_description': "Build your farmstead by sowing fields and raising livestock.

Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backgammon</strong> may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.</p>\n\n<p>The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.</p>\n\n<p>It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).</p>\n\n<p>The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle.

Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.</p>\n\n<p>The game has its origins in the Indian game <a  href="/boardgame/18011/chaturanga"   >Chaturanga</a>, and became <a  href="/boardgame/26064/shatranj"   >Shatranj</a> when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Ding Liren, China.

Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.</p>\n\n<p>The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.</p>\n\n', 'maxplayers': '5', 'maxplaytime': '240', 'minplayers': '3', 'minplaytime': '240', 'numcomments': '2161', 'numfans': 299, 'numgeeklists': '4753', 'numhasparts': '5', 'numowned': '8348', 'numplays': '7790', 'numplays_month': '3', 'numpreordered': '86', 'numprevowned': '1654', 'numtrading': '277', 'numwanting': '491', 'numwantparts': '5', 'numwanttobuy': '380', 'numwanttoplay': '2034', 'numweights': '794', 'numwish': '2210', 'numwishlistcomments': '321', 'playmonth': '2025-06', 'short_description': 'Players represent political parties attempting to gain power in Germany.', 'stddev': '1.55853', 'usersrated': '5916', 'views': '1119072', 'yearpublished': '1986'}}, {'id': 'dropolter', 'name': 'DroPolter', 'description': 'Drop only the proper items to receive reward bells...that cannot be dropped.', 'q_rules': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rzjqPf2cAPQyohdSUgHmiWlr_34LnO3A?usp=drive_link', 'links': [], 'labels': ['Oink Games', 'Dexterity', 'Kawaii', 'Small Box'], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/405537/dropolter', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/W9rXEN6j-hJ-5QMLmnullA__opengraph/img/uUH38XcZiarZYSGynlZqnu2FaVc=/0x444:363x635/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc()/pic7836564.png', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '6.76736', 'avgweight': '1', 'baverage': '5.54281', 'description': "<p>Your hand is always full in <em><strong>DroPolter</strong></em>, which makes it a challenge to drop only the correct items that the ghosts want to see.</p>\n\n<p>To start the game, each player has a hand of five items: a red plastic cube, a blue wooden key, and so on.

One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.</p>\n\n<p>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial.

The game begins in the early eighteenth-century, when the Company has a weak foothold on the subcontinent. Over the course of the game, the Company might grow into the most powerful and insidious corporation in the world or collapse under the weight of its own ambition.</p>\n\n<p><em>John Company</em> is a game about state-sponsored trade monopoly. Unlike most economic games players often do not control their own firms. Instead, they will collectively guide the Company by securing positions of power, attempting to steer the Company&rsquo;s fate in ways that benefit their own interests. However, the Company is an unwieldy thing. It is difficult to do anything alone, and players will often need to negotiate with one another. In John Company, most everything is up for negotiation.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this game isn&rsquo;t about wealth; it&rsquo;s about reputation. Each turn some of your family members may retire from their Company positions, giving them the opportunity to establish estates. Critically, players do not have full control over when these retirements happen. You will often need to borrow money from other players to make the best use for a chance of retirement. Players also gain victory points by competing in the London Season for prestige and securing fashionable properties.</p>\n\n<p><em>John Company</em> engages very seriously with its theme. It is meant as a frank portrait of an institution that was as dysfunctional as it was influential. Accordingly, the game wrestles many of the key themes of imperialism and globalization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and how those developments were felt domestically. As such, this game might not be suitable for all players.

The game ends when each player has completed a 5x5 grid (or failed to do so), and points are counted based on number of connecting tiles and valuable crown symbols.</p>\n\n', 'maxplayers': '4', 'maxplaytime': '25', 'minplayers': '2', 'minplaytime': '15', 'numcomments': '6508', 'numfans': 1453, 'numgeeklists': '4823', 'numhasparts': '19', 'numowned': '78666', 'numplays': '367021', 'numplays_month': '2119', 'numprevowned': '4899', 'numtrading': '988', 'numwanting': '360', 'numwantparts': '12', 'numweights': '1045', 'numwish': '4549', 'numwishlistcomments': '741', 'playmonth': '2024-02', 'short_description': 'Build a kingdom with varied terrains on domino-shaped tiles in this fast family game.', 'stddev': '1.12437', 'usersrated': '46522', 'views': '1514763', 'yearpublished': '2016'}}, {'id': 'kings-dilemma', 'name': "The King's Dilemma", 'description': "Leaders join in council to vote on the kingdom's issues, but with hidden motives!", 'q_rules': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UwJwFkCyqTr8sEzzd-doFWYvfa8AMhr0?usp=drive_link', 'links': [], 'labels': ['Legacy', 'Strategy', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Heavy', 'Modern'], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/245655/kings-dilemma', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/FJlTdSMkK5hMNtCympJFmg__opengraph/img/MjNguH_ZRrMMDrEGA0kvq0AMbW8=/0x0:850x446/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc()/pic5429837.jpg', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '7.77989', 'avgweight': '2.2517', 'baverage': '7.14303', 'description': "<p><em><strong>The King's Dilemma</strong></em> is an interactive narrative experience with legacy elements, featuring several branching storylines leading to many possible finales and an evolving deck of event cards at its core.

In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of game play, <em>Pax Pamir</em> is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.</p>\n\n<p>To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.</p>\n\n<p>After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.</p>\n\n", 'maxplayers': '5', 'maxplaytime': '120', 'minplayers': '1', 'minplaytime': '45', 'numcomments': '2324', 'numfans': 1467, 'numgeeklists': '1681', 'numhasparts': '10', 'numowned': '19850', 'numplays': '49164', 'numplays_month': '911', 'numprevowned': '1234', 'numtrading': '177', 'numwanting': '895', 'numwantparts': '1', 'numweights': '648', 'numwish': '5732', 'numwishlistcomments': '533', 'playmonth': '2024-02', 'short_description': 'Swing the tides of "The Great Game" as countries vie for control of Afghanistan.', 'stddev': '1.50426', 'usersrated': '13268', 'views': '1749040', 'yearpublished': '2019'}}, {'id': 'poker', 'name': 'Poker', 'description': "You've got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.", 'q_rules': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18iHT3TUfxDYVeoSnzX661quh1CNTBuxp?usp=drive_link', 'links': [], 'labels': ['Classic', 'Card Game', 'Family Game', 'Strategy', 'Bluffing', 'Pre-Boardgames'], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1115/poker', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QhsvR9GY0LbTpj27fairWA__opengraph/img/FFuk1EuC8UkRBQhlznzheUMpbbs=/0x61:509x347/fit-in/1200x630/filters:fill(blur):strip_icc()/pic186610.jpg', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '6.71605', 'avgweight': '2.4258', 'baverage': '6.47637', 'description': '<p><strong>Poker</strong> is played with a <a class="" href="/wiki/page/standard_deck_playing_card_games#">standard deck</a> of 52-cards, and sometimes Jokers are added as wild cards.

As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family.

Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.</p>\n\n<p>The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.</p>\n\n<p>The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.</p>\n\n<p>The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).</p>\n\n<p>The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.</p>\n\n", 'maxplayers': '2', 'maxplaytime': '60', 'minplayers': '2', 'minplaytime': '60', 'numcomments': '3740', 'numfans': 872, 'numgeeklists': '2921', 'numhasparts': '21', 'numowned': '37308', 'numplays': '76510', 'numplays_month': '24', 'numprevowned': '2901', 'numtrading': '381', 'numwanting': '856', 'numwantparts': '12', 'numweights': '667', 'numwish': '5964', 'numwishlistcomments': '1054', 'playmonth': '2024-03', 'short_description': 'Outwit your rival by selecting where to place nomad workers on a dynamic desert grid.', 'stddev': '1.11377', 'usersrated': '23090', 'views': '1165751', 'yearpublished': '2012'}}, {'id': 'the-quest-for-el-dorado', 'name': 'The Quest for El Dorado', 'description': 'Race through a dense South American jungle in pursuit of the legendary city of gold.', 'q_rules': '', 'links': [], 'labels': ['Reiner Knizia', 'Racing', 'Strategy', 'Deck Building', 'Modern Family Boardgames'], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217372/the-quest-for-el-dorado', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/b5VyYjNfAxJ4Z-Dx2UWlqg__opengraph/img/LFOBRbv1U6v3uIrCsZONqqQpiOc=/0x0:700x368/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc()/pic7945692.jpg', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '7.7035', 'avgweight': '1.9399', 'baverage': '7.51839', 'description': '<p>In <em><strong>The Quest for El Dorado</strong></em>, players take the roles of expedition leaders who have embarked on a search for the legendary land of gold in the dense jungles of South America.

There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert\'s oases?

However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose &quot;no trump&quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.</p>\n\n<p>The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may <em>always</em> play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.</p>\n\n<p>After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.</p>\n\n<p>After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.</p>\n\n<p>A common variant in <em>Wizard</em> is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.</p>\n\n', 'maxplayers': '6', 'maxplaytime': '45', 'minplayers': '3', 'minplaytime': '45', 'numcomments': '2265', 'numfans': 274, 'numgeeklists': '1896', 'numhasparts': '6', 'numowned': '19965', 'numplays': '52237', 'numplays_month': '287', 'numprevowned': '1233', 'numtrading': '339', 'numwanting': '54', 'numwantparts': '6', 'numweights': '578', 'numwish': '553', 'numwishlistcomments': '121', 'playmonth': '2024-02', 'short_description': "Predict how many tricks you'll win, with the help of Wizards and Jesters.", 'stddev': '1.40867', 'usersrated': '11288', 'views': '549727', 'yearpublished': '1984'}}];

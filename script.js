One of the things some gamers like about this game is that the game has no \'chance\' element. That is to say, if players wished to play two games with the same moves, the outcome would be the same also.</p>\n\n<p>This game takes the basic mechanics from Tresham\'s <a  href="/boardgame/1823/1829"   >1829</a>, and adds several new elements. Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map. The stock manipulation aspect of the game is widely-regarded as one of the best. The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes. Plus each <a class="" href="/wiki/page/18xx#">18xx</a> title adds new and different elements to the game. This game features private rail companies and an extremely vicious, \'robber baron\' oriented stock market. A game is finished when the bank runs out of money or one player is forced to declare bankruptcy, and the player with the greatest personal holdings wins.</p>\n\n<p>The 2011 version of <em>1830</em> was published by Mayfair Games in partnership with Lookout Games of Germany. This publication was developed under license from Francis Tresham in co-operation with Bruce Shelley (the original <em>1830</em> developer). This version contains rules and components for Francis Tresham\'s original classic design, a faster-playing basic game, and new variants from some of the world\'s best railroad game developers.</p>\n\n', 'maxplayers': '7', 'maxplaytime': '360', 'minplayers': '2', 'minplaytime': '180', 'numcomments': '1889', 'numfans': 440, 'numgeeklists': '2948', 'numhasparts': '2', 'numowned': '9035', 'numplays': '16928', 'numplays_month': '51', 'numpreordered': '33', 'numprevowned': '1288', 'numtrading': '206', 'numwanting': '377', 'numwantparts': '5', 'numwanttobuy': '339', 'numwanttoplay': '1424', 'numweights': '591', 'numwish': '1643', 'numwishlistcomments': '291', 'playmonth': '2025-06', 'short_description': 'A classic game of managing railroads and investing wisely.', 'stddev': '1.60569', 'usersrated': '5847', 'views': '1106557', 'yearpublished': '1986'}}, {'id': '3-witches', 'name': '3 Witches', 'description': 'The three witches canÃ¡t agree - every trick is a 2 vs 1 battle for the cauldron!', 'q_rules': '', 'links': [], 'labels': [], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/447707/3-witches', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/kY4wrTwYv36zmUVmp2oYLg__opengraph/img/wDT3OiCiVDaZUT0Tqr08x2DrV6A=/0x0:1535x806/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc()/pic8957578.jpg', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '7.25904', 'avgweight': '2', 'baverage': '5.63693', 'description': '<p><em><strong>3 Witches</strong></em> is a must-follow,  trick-taking game with no trump suit.

As in the original game, each acquired card can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.

Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.</p>\n\n<p>Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as they are acquired, the cost for those resources increases for the opponent, representing the owner's dominance in this area.</p>\n\n<p>You can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital (also giving you a bonus at certain positions). If you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately. Or if you acquire six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately.

Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states.

One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason the people of these times became such strong seafarers was their unfortunate agricultural situation: crop shortfalls caused great distress.</p>\n\n<p>In this game, you will raid and explore new territories.

A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.</p>\n\n<p>Each year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.</p>\n\n<p>You will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation. It all comes down to how much you&rsquo;re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you&rsquo;re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards.</p>\n\n<p>UPC 681706716909</p>\n\n', 'maxplayers': '4', 'maxplaytime': '120', 'minplayers': '1', 'minplaytime': '30', 'numcomments': '4773', 'numfans': 2674, 'numgeeklists': '4853', 'numhasparts': '16', 'numowned': '40846', 'numplays': '120706', 'numplays_month': '523', 'numpreordered': '122', 'numprevowned': '3390', 'numtrading': '285', 'numwanting': '1981', 'numwantparts': '16', 'numwanttobuy': '3887', 'numwanttoplay': '9538', 'numweights': '1114', 'numwish': '15631', 'numwishlistcomments': '1564', 'playmonth': '2025-06', 'short_description': 'Puzzle together the life of a Viking village as you hunt, farm, craft, and explore.', 'stddev': '1.37995', 'usersrated': '31202', 'views': '3413430', 'yearpublished': '2016'}}, {'id': 'a-feast-for-odin-the-norwegians', 'name': 'A Feast for Odin: The Norwegians', 'description': 'The Norwegians raid, trade and settle new lands from the Orkneys to the Irish Sea.', 'q_rules': 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VVXTtftCnxGorfQmuioZ0A6XGNtFVZNM/view?usp=drive_link', 'links': [], 'labels': ['Uwe Rosenberg', 'Worker Placement', 'Resource Management', 'Tile Laying', 'Modern', 'Expansion'], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/216788/a-feast-for-odin-the-norwegians', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/hzgTiNWQ7Vh3Ywr9OhXvtQ__opengraph/img/3PztjHQWGNslLEMA4qH_Asi5k14=/0x0:1323x695/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc()/pic4278032.jpg', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '0', 'avgweight': '0', 'baverage': '0', 'description': '<p>The first large expansion for <em>A Feast for Odin</em>, <em><strong>The Norwegians</strong></em>, includes a viking-sized number of additions to the game, adding new strategies and puzzle-tiles.</p>\n\n<p>Renewed action board: The largest of the new additions, made of three double-sided pieces that can be flipped to show different actions based on the number of players, opening up new action paths and increasing the chances of players getting in each others\' way. It contains new opportunities like butchering, elk-hunting, fishing, and thievery, along with changes for some old actions. It\'s now easier, for example, to play an animal strategy, because you can now get two of the same animals in one action. There is also a new fifth column with (better) actions that require only one viking. For example, you can now forge a grey special tile with a sword value of 8 or less by using an ore and only one viking! Another totally new 1-viking action is to do a &quot;small emigration&quot; using a whaling boat, which covers one space at the banquet table instead of two but is worth 7VP and costs no silver to do so. And as a bonus, you can send two vikings to this column instead of one to play an occupation card in addition to the action. The catch is, once you use an action from the fifth column, you can\'t place any more vikings for the rest of this round.</p>\n\n<p>New puzzle-tiles: 2x5 rectangle (horse/pregnant horse/leather/vadmal) and 5 spaces in a &quot;U&quot; shape (herbs/pig/antlers/tools). The red versions of these tiles feature two new animals, horses (worth 6VP) and pigs (worth 1VP and breed every round as opposed to every other round) respectively, adding yet more paths for an animal strategy. There are also five new grey special tiles such as a pan, a hauberk and an anvil, most of which can be forged with ore. Also included is a third goods box to hold all the new tiles.</p>\n\n<p>Four new exploration boards: Islands on the frontside (Isle of Man, Isle of Skye, Islay, Outer Hebrides) with Irish coastal viking-settlements on the backside (Waterford, Wexford, Cork, Limerick), where people from Norway came to stay through the winter, to trade at, and to settle nearby. Also included are renewed versions of the four exploration boards from the base game, with updated iconography and some with adjusted VPs.</p>\n\n<p>New buildings: Also totally new is the idea of a random start-building. Everybody gets one of the six double-sided &quot;artisan shed&quot; boards, and whenever a player could build a shed during the game, they may instead build the front or backside of their artisan shed. Just like the stonehouse and longhouse, the artisan sheds offer new spaces to place orange and red tiles to earn bonus goods, silver and VP, and many of them require specific tiles to be placed in specific spaces. So everybody has another different start-opportunity - like the occupation cards.</p>\n\n<p>VP tokens: Another new option is that, whenever a player would play an occupation card into the game, the player may instead discard the card for a VP token, which are worth 4, 3 or 2VP at the end of the game. A nice little competitive element, as there are a limited number of the 4VP and 3VP tokens.</p>\n\n<p>Other stuff: The expansion also includes another mountain strip, more two-silver coins and more beans/mead and oil/runestone tiles.</p>\n\n<p>The expansion includes another almanac about the new game-elements and their viking-history.

Each player starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit into his/her strategy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Agricola</strong> is a turn-based game, and the problem to be overcome is that each available action can be taken by only one player each round so it's important to be careful about your choices.  There are countless strategies, some of which depend on your hand of cards.  Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions...</p>\n\n", 'maxplayers': '5', 'maxplaytime': '150', 'minplayers': '1', 'minplaytime': '30', 'numcomments': '14039', 'numfans': 6797, 'numgeeklists': '15924', 'numhasparts': '57', 'numowned': '88141', 'numplays': '285914', 'numplays_month': '396', 'numpreordered': '151', 'numprevowned': '9916', 'numtrading': '1426', 'numwanting': '1142', 'numwantparts': '54', 'numwanttobuy': '3044', 'numwanttoplay': '7339', 'numweights': '6406', 'numwish': '12692', 'numwishlistcomments': '1181', 'playmonth': '2025-06', 'short_description': "Build your farmstead by sowing fields and raising livestock.

Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Backgammon</strong> may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.</p>\n\n<p>The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.</p>\n\n<p>It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).</p>\n\n<p>The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle.

Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times.

Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.</p>\n\n<p>When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the &quot;beanometer&quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times.

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.</p>\n\n<p>The game has its origins in the Indian game <a  href="/boardgame/18011/chaturanga"   >Chaturanga</a>, and became <a  href="/boardgame/26064/shatranj"   >Shatranj</a> when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Ding Liren, China.

The game begins in the early eighteenth-century, when the Company has a weak foothold on the subcontinent. Over the course of the game, the Company might grow into the most powerful and insidious corporation in the world or collapse under the weight of its own ambition.</p>\n\n<p><em>John Company</em> is a game about state-sponsored trade monopoly. Unlike most economic games players often do not control their own firms. Instead, they will collectively guide the Company by securing positions of power, attempting to steer the Company&rsquo;s fate in ways that benefit their own interests. However, the Company is an unwieldy thing. It is difficult to do anything alone, and players will often need to negotiate with one another. In John Company, most everything is up for negotiation.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this game isn&rsquo;t about wealth; it&rsquo;s about reputation. Each turn some of your family members may retire from their Company positions, giving them the opportunity to establish estates. Critically, players do not have full control over when these retirements happen. You will often need to borrow money from other players to make the best use for a chance of retirement. Players also gain victory points by competing in the London Season for prestige and securing fashionable properties.</p>\n\n<p><em>John Company</em> engages very seriously with its theme. It is meant as a frank portrait of an institution that was as dysfunctional as it was influential. Accordingly, the game wrestles many of the key themes of imperialism and globalization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and how those developments were felt domestically.

This cooperative game for 2 players was designed by Chris Klimowski and is sure to be a big hit.</p>\n\n<p>In <em><strong>Moving Pictures</strong></em> players take turns placing numbered scene cards from their hand into the shared Timeline row in hopes of getting all 6 cards in order. The catch? They can't speak or signal to each other, so they'll have to watch each other's play closely for clues. Each card also has an effect listed which can impact placement, swap cards around, or even allow players a rare opportunity to share information.</p>\n\n<p>Getting it right once is a feat in itself but a full game of <em><strong>Moving Pictures</strong></em> is played over 3 Acts. The Timeline grows with each Act, making each round harder than the one before. Thankfully you also have access to 2 Deleted Scenes: if the round would end with scenes out of order, you can spend a Deleted Scene to hide one card. These Deleted Scenes don&rsquo;t refresh, meaning that you only get 2 mistakes before the credits roll.</p>\n\n", 'maxplayers': '2', 'maxplaytime': '20', 'minplayers': '1', 'minplaytime': '20', 'numcomments': '58', 'numfans': 13, 'numgeeklists': '44', 'numhasparts': '2', 'numowned': '722', 'numplays': '633', 'numplays_month': '9', 'numprevowned': '34', 'numtrading': '14', 'numwanting': '24', 'numwantparts': '0', 'numweights': '7', 'numwish': '118', 'numwishlistcomments': '11', 'playmonth': '2024-02', 'short_description': 'Work with your partner to put each scene in order... without communicating!', 'stddev': '1.12844', 'usersrated': '173', 'views': '18345', 'yearpublished': '2021'}}, {'id': 'moving-wild', 'name': 'Moving Wild', 'description': 'Build your national park and fill it with cute animals, both fierce and friendly!', 'q_rules': '', 'links': [], 'labels': ['Oink Games', 'Card Game', 'Solo', 'Drafting', 'Strategy', 'Small Box'], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/423270/moving-wild', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/Y4XMZWJyiUneAA2wT_bkLg__opengraph/img/0CQIa4Hj_d_pxoyPxZLuReqgzGg=/0x208:361x398/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc()/pic8591006.png', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '6.98303', 'avgweight': '1.9333', 'baverage': '5.81888', 'description': "<p>Some animals have begun their migration, going around and around in search of a new place to live.

Western histories often call this period &quot;The Great Game&quot; because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of game play, <em>Pax Pamir</em> is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.</p>\n\n<p>To survive, players will organize into coalitions. Throughout the game, the dominance of the different coalitions will be evaluated by the players when a special card, called a &quot;Dominance Check&quot;, is resolved. If a single coalition has a commanding lead during one of these checks, those players loyal to that coalition will receive victory points based on their influence in their coalition. However, if Afghanistan remains fragmented during one of these checks, players instead will receive victory points based on their personal power base.</p>\n\n<p>After each Dominance Check, victory is checked and the game will be partially reset, offering players a fresh attempt to realize their ambitions. The game ends when a single player is able to achieve a lead of four or more victory points  or after the fourth and final Dominance Check is resolved.</p>\n\n", 'maxplayers': '5', 'maxplaytime': '120', 'minplayers': '1', 'minplaytime': '45', 'numcomments': '2324', 'numfans': 1467, 'numgeeklists': '1681', 'numhasparts': '10', 'numowned': '19850', 'numplays': '49164', 'numplays_month': '911', 'numprevowned': '1234', 'numtrading': '177', 'numwanting': '895', 'numwantparts': '1', 'numweights': '648', 'numwish': '5732', 'numwishlistcomments': '533', 'playmonth': '2024-02', 'short_description': 'Swing the tides of "The Great Game" as countries vie for control of Afghanistan.', 'stddev': '1.50426', 'usersrated': '13268', 'views': '1749040', 'yearpublished': '2019'}}, {'id': 'poker', 'name': 'Poker', 'description': "You've got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.", 'q_rules': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18iHT3TUfxDYVeoSnzX661quh1CNTBuxp?usp=drive_link', 'links': [], 'labels': ['Classic', 'Card Game', 'Family Game', 'Strategy', 'Bluffing', 'Pre-Boardgames'], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1115/poker', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/QhsvR9GY0LbTpj27fairWA__opengraph/img/FFuk1EuC8UkRBQhlznzheUMpbbs=/0x61:509x347/fit-in/1200x630/filters:fill(blur):strip_icc()/pic186610.jpg', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '6.71605', 'avgweight': '2.4258', 'baverage': '6.47637', 'description': '<p><strong>Poker</strong> is played with a <a class="" href="/wiki/page/standard_deck_playing_card_games#">standard deck</a> of 52-cards, and sometimes Jokers are added as wild cards.

Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own.

As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.</p>\n\n<p>The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.</p>\n\n<p>The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.</p>\n\n<p>The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).</p>\n\n<p>The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.</p>\n\n", 'maxplayers': '2', 'maxplaytime': '60', 'minplayers': '2', 'minplaytime': '60', 'numcomments': '3740', 'numfans': 872, 'numgeeklists': '2921', 'numhasparts': '21', 'numowned': '37308', 'numplays': '76510', 'numplays_month': '24', 'numprevowned': '2901', 'numtrading': '381', 'numwanting': '856', 'numwantparts': '12', 'numweights': '667', 'numwish': '5964', 'numwishlistcomments': '1054', 'playmonth': '2024-03', 'short_description': 'Outwit your rival by selecting where to place nomad workers on a dynamic desert grid.', 'stddev': '1.11377', 'usersrated': '23090', 'views': '1165751', 'yearpublished': '2012'}}, {'id': 'tarot', 'name': 'Tarot', 'description': 'Take your cards and bid a contract to win at this game of French Tarot.', 'q_rules': '', 'links': [], 'labels': [], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4505/tarot', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/DDrDIu8zfnvuvL4-7Ph_UA__opengraph/img/c9Id7ZJehdhPk7WA8qOE1vz1gcU=/0x57:544x343/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc()/pic8884433.jpg', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '6.88386', 'avgweight': '2.4909', 'baverage': '5.87816', 'description': "Not to be confused with divinatory tarot, the game of tarot probably comes from Italy.

The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy.

There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert\'s oases?

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized.

Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, <em>Tigris &amp; Euphrates</em> included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game.

At the end of the hand, if he is correct he will get double points (or money if playing for money.)</p>\n\n<p>Once the bid has been finalized the players play out the tricks. When the tricks have been finished the players see if the bid was successful. If the bid was successful the losing players give the winner the value of the bid (points or money). If the bid was unsuccessful the loser gives the other two players the value of the bid. If a player has called a Kontra he gets double points.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ulti</strong> has no fixed end point and players can play as many hands as they have time for.</p>\n\n', 'maxplayers': '3', 'maxplaytime': '0', 'minplayers': '3', 'minplaytime': '0', 'numcomments': '25', 'numfans': 13, 'numgeeklists': '45', 'numhasparts': '0', 'numowned': '87', 'numplays': '388', 'numplays_month': '7', 'numpreordered': '0', 'numprevowned': '3', 'numtrading': '0', 'numwanting': '1', 'numwantparts': '0', 'numwanttobuy': '1', 'numwanttoplay': '52', 'numweights': '15', 'numwish': '19', 'numwishlistcomments': '4', 'playmonth': '2025-11', 'short_description': 'Ulti is the national card game of Hungary.', 'stddev': '1.6561', 'usersrated': '78', 'views': '29912', 'yearpublished': '0'}}, {'id': 'unhappy-king-charles-second-edition', 'name': 'Unhappy King Charles (second edition)', 'description': 'Rewrite the history of the English Civil War in this Card-Driven wargame.', 'q_rules': 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BK2Bg_OUGGvmSQmQFDrJNwGG0RfTWS9f?usp=drive_link', 'links': [], 'labels': ['Historical', 'Card-Driven', 'Wargame', 'War Game', 'Strategy', 'Modern Historical Boardgames', 'Two Player', 'Asymmetrical'], 'url': 'https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/391780/unhappy-king-charles-second-edition', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9dvq-wahf0apxZsc6R2Qig__opengraph/img/IT13lqKpjHNW6kRe8a98b5Fd964=/0x0:1350x709/fit-in/1200x630/filters:strip_icc()/pic7581310.png', 'notes': '', 'stats': {'average': '8.38478', 'avgweight': '3.5', 'baverage': '5.55635', 'description': '<p>The year is 1642 and England is torn apart by a civil war between King Charles I and his supporters, the Royalists, and the Parliamentarians.

The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and must either cooperate or compete to get their horses over the finish line.</p>\n\n<p>There are various differences between Winner\'s Circle and Turf Horse Racing. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval instead of a straight line. The horses start on separate starting spaces instead of all together on the same space. During the race, horses cannot share spaces so if a horse has to move to an occupied space, they have to move back to the last available space. A Pace chip has been added to space 18 where the first horse to pass it receives it and earns a higher payout at the end of the race (if they finish top 3).

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose &quot;no trump&quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.</p>\n\n<p>The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may <em>always</em> play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.</p>\n\n<p>After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.</p>\n\n<p>After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.</p>\n\n<p>A common variant in <em>Wizard</em> is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.</p>\n\n', 'maxplayers': '6', 'maxplaytime': '45', 'minplayers': '3', 'minplaytime': '45', 'numcomments': '2265', 'numfans': 274, 'numgeeklists': '1896', 'numhasparts': '6', 'numowned': '19965', 'numplays': '52237', 'numplays_month': '287', 'numprevowned': '1233', 'numtrading': '339', 'numwanting': '54', 'numwantparts': '6', 'numweights': '578', 'numwish': '553', 'numwishlistcomments': '121', 'playmonth': '2024-02', 'short_description': "Predict how many tricks you'll win, with the help of Wizards and Jesters.", 'stddev': '1.40867', 'usersrated': '11288', 'views': '549727', 'yearpublished': '1984'}}];

  Background to the Game


  It was developed in the 20th century from the rules of the 18th century card game
  Marias and the 19th century card game Talonmarias. It is traditionally played with
  a special deck of cards called the William Tell deck. The deck has 32 cards - like
  a modern Skat deck - but uses German suits (Bells, Hearts, Leaves, Acorns).


  The Game


  Ulti is a trick-taking game for three players. In each hand the player who wins
  the bidding chooses trumps (or no trumps) and plays alone against the other two
  players in partnership.


  Each player is dealt 10 cards. The start player is allowed to look at and swap with
  the two cards left over (called a Talon). Once they have done this they must make
  a bid. Each player in turn can choose to look at the Talon and swap cards with it
  but if they do they must make a bid which is of higher value than the previous one.


  Numerous different value bids can be made. These range from winning the hand, taking
  the last trick with the seven of the trump suit (Ulti), loosing every trick (Betli)
  or winning every trick (Durchmars). The value of most of these bids can be doubled
  by playing the Heart suit as the trump card. If a player thinks the winning bid
  will not be successful he can make a bid saying this when he plays the first trick
  (called a Kontra). At the end of the hand, if he is correct he will get double points
  (or money if playing for money.)


  Once the bid has been finalized the players play out the tricks. When the tricks
  have been finished the players see if the bid was successful. If the bid was successful
  the losing players give the winner the value of the bid (points or money). If the
  bid was unsuccessful the loser gives the other two players the value of the bid.
  If a player has called a Kontra he gets double points.


  Ulti has no fixed end point and players can play as many hands as they have time
  for.'

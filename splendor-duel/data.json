  "description": "<p>Confront your rival guild in a race for victory. Take Gem and Pearl tokens from the common board, then purchase cards, gather bonuses, royal favors, and prestige.</p>\n\n<p>Discover new twists and strategic opportunities derived from Splendor, the original best-selling game. Acquire cards with impressive powers, take advantage of special Privileges, and fight over scarce access to Pearls.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Splendor Duel</strong></em> is a two-player only standalone game based on <em>Splendor</em> that retains some of the main gameplay mechanisms of that design, while being a bit more complex, dynamic, interactive, rich, tense, and mean.</p>\n\n<p>The game features a main board shared by both opponents, card powers, and three victory conditions.</p>\n\n",

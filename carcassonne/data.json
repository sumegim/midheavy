  "description": "<p><em><strong>Carcassonne</strong></em> is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.</p>\n\n<p>During a game of <em>Carcassonne</em>, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>First game in the <a class=\"\" href=\"/wiki/page/Carcassonne_series#\">Carcassonne series</a>.</p>\n\n",
